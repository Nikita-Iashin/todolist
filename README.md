This is part one - "Simple MVC App for Testing"

1. Implement a simple MVC application using Spring Boot. This application will serve as the test target for your test automation project.
Define the necessary endpoints and business logic within the application.
Containerization with Docker:

2. Dockerize each microservice, including the UI Service, Report Service, Security Service, Contract Testing Service, and Integration Test Service.
Create Docker containers for each service to ensure consistent deployment and testing environments.
Service Implementation with Spring:

3. Implement the UI Service as a simple Spring MVC application that provides a user interface for interacting with the system.
Implement the Report Service to receive and save Allure reports generated by the UI Service's tests. Add functionality to show the historical reports.
Implement the Security Service to handle token-based authentication and authorization for all the microservices.
Test Automation Framework:

4. Set up a test automation framework using a testing framework like JUnit or TestNG.
Implement UI tests for the UI Service using a UI testing framework such as Selenium or Cypress. Generate Allure reports for these tests.
Implement integration tests for each microservice, including mocked integration tests using WireMock. These tests will verify the functionality and interactions of each service.
Use Rest Assured to perform contract testing for the APIs exposed by the microservices. Compare the responses and JSON bodies with predefined contracts.
Allure Report Generation:

5. Configure the test automation framework to generate Allure reports for the UI tests. These reports will contain detailed information about the test execution, including test cases, status, and attachments.
Save the Allure reports generated by the UI tests in a suitable format (e.g., XML or JSON).
Report Service:

6. Implement the Report Service to receive and store the Allure reports generated by the UI Service's tests.
Store the Allure reports in a database or file system, ensuring proper indexing and organization for historical reporting.
Implement functionality in the Report Service to query and display the historical reports, allowing users to view past test results.
Security Service:

7. Implement the Security Service to handle token-based authentication and authorization for all microservices.
Integrate the Security Service with the other microservices to ensure secure communication and proper access control.
Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD) with Jenkins:

8. Set up a Jenkins pipeline to automate the build, testing, and deployment processes.
Configure the pipeline to trigger the test automation suite whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
Include stages in the pipeline for building Docker images, running tests (including UI, integration, and contract tests), and deploying the microservices to the desired environments.
